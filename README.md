# Algorithms-for-data-science

This is Xiangyu Liu's repository for course CSOR 4246 at Columbia University. 

This repository focuses on the design and analysis of algorithms relevant to data science and machine learning. I complete general design paradigms as well as specific problems. A preliminary list of topics follows.

Asymptotics, sorting, searching, fast integer and matrix multiplication
Graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, shortest paths)
Data compression
Dynamic programming
Network flows
Linear programming
Reductions and NP-completeness
Approximation algorithms
The web graph, hubs & authorities, page rank
SVD and PCA
Hashing, Bloom filters, count-min sketch
Basic streaming algorithms
Nearest neighbors and locality sensitive hashing
